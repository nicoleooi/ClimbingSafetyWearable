The Climbing Safety Wearable is a capstone project developed by students in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of Queen's University. The wearable is a chest strap paired with one's phone. It is designed to be worn by rock climbers to collect health data, detect a fall, and prevent cognitive fatigue.
